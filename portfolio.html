	<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><center>Our project is Tic Tac Turtle. Instead of X's and O's there are turtles. When you first run the program you are asked to press Enter to start. Next, the program shows a new screen with the Tic Tac Toe board. You will also see columns, X, Y, & Z, and rows A, B, & C. In the console the first player and second player are asked to type in the box or square they want to go to. The program also has a collision system to detect if a player puts their turtle on an occupied square and asks that player to re-type their desired box. Then you play until someone wins. That's a quick summary of our project.</h2>

	<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><center>Our project is Ice Fishing. When you first run the program you are asked for your name so that it can be updated in the leaderboard if you make it. Next, you play the game by pressing the up and down keys to move the hook. When the hooks hits a fish you catch it and it adds five points to your score. You have 20 seconds to catch as many fish as possible. Once the timer runs out the screen clears and the leaderboard is shown on the screen. At the bottom of the leaderboard the program tells you if you made the leaderboard and if you made top three by stating, "Gold", "Silver", or "Bronze". That's a quick summmary of our game.</h2>

	<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><center>Our project is Dino In The City. For this project our group made a story in scratch instead of with python. When you first play the program it takes you to a title screen that asks you to press "s" to start. Then you see two characters, Dino and Frank, these characters will go on an adventure. You are given options throughout the story, if you choose wrong then you die and have to restart, if you choose correctly then you are able to move to the next scene and choose another option. At the end of the story Dino and Frank go home and conclude their day of adventure. That's a quick summary of our story.</h2>
