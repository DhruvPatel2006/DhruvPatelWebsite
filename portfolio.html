	<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><center>Our project is Tic Tac Turtle. Instead of X's and O's there are turtles. When you first run the program you are asked to press Enter to start. Next, the program shows a new screen with the Tic Tac Toe board. You will also see columnns, X, Y, & Z, and rows A, B, & C. In the console the first player and second player are asked to type in the box or square they want to go to. The program also has a collision system to detect if a player puts their turtle on an occupied square and asks that player to re-type their desired box. Then you play until someone wins. That's a quick summary of our project. Y</h2>
